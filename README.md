# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier
#### A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using multiple models. Built for ECS 171: Machine Learning Final Project.

## 🚀 Overview
- Preprocessed SMS dataset (~27.9k messages) with tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Evaluated Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC.

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest performed best overall with the highest accuracy, precision, and F1-score.
- SVM also showed strong generalization (Accuracy ~98%, AUC 0.99).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (scikit-learn, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas)
- Models: Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Neural Network

## 📚 Skills Learned
- Text preprocessing & feature engineering
